# DATA PROCESSING

## Adding Columns

1. Open the notebook extra-columns.ipynb. Learn how to add some extra columns to the existed DataFrame. Then, complete all tasks in the notebook.

1. The continents.csv file contains data on the area and number of inhabitants of some continents. Create a notebook in which create a DataFrame with the data contained in the CSV file. Display the contents of the DataFrame. Then, add a column in which calculate the population density, i.e. the number of inhabitants per 1 km2. View the modified DataFrame.


## Data Sorting

1. Data sorting allows you to arrange data in a specific order. This makes it easier to understand, organize, and find relevant information. As a result, information processing becomes more effective. In addition, presenting data in an orderly manner is more readable for humans. Sorting allows data to be presented in a way that facilitates understanding. And finally, with sorted data, you can make more effective decisions. For example, when analyzing financial data, sorting transactions by date helps you better understand trends.

1. Open the notebook data-sorting.ipynb. Learn how to sort data according to the specified columns. Then, complete all tasks in the notebook.

1. Create a new notebook. Based on the file european-countries.csv, create a DataFrame. Then, do the following tasks:

    * display currency names alphabetically (only one column)
    * display data organised by the population, descending
    * display data organised by the region and then by the country
    * display data organised by the population density (first, add an extra column)
    * display the name of the capital and currency (only two columns), arrange the data by currency and then by the name of the capital city



## Creating Queries

1. Data selection refers to the process of choosing specific data from a larger collection that are relevant to a particular purpose or analysis. It is a crucial step in various fields, including research, business intelligence, data science, and machine learning.

1. The DataFrame contains a query() method that you can use to select data.

1. Open the notebook creating-queries.ipynb. Learn how to select data according to the specified criteria. Then, complete all tasks in the notebook.

## Data Grouping

1. Data grouping enables you to apply aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, etc., to groups of rows based on their values in specified columns. This allows you to summarize data and generate new values representing entire groups. For example, you can count the number of customers in each country, find the average order value for each product category, or identify the highest-grossing month for your online store.

1. Open the notebook data-grouping.ipynb. Learn how to calculate aggregated values based on the specified criteria. Then, complete all tasks in the notebook.
